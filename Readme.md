##**Project Overview**

* Athkam Asapuwa is a pottery shop located in Kegalle district. They used the traditional method to sell their products. So I decided to take it to the next level.
* Therefore I created this website for this shop to increase their productivity. 
* I created this site with an Admin Pannel and a shopping cart to dynamically update the website.
* Users can select, add to cart and buy any products through product list.


##**Technologies Used**

* I used HTML to create the front-end of this website, used Bootstrap CSS to style it and Javascript to add some functionality to it.
* Then I choose PHP as the language for the back-end and MySQL as DBMS.
* And also I used Photoshop as the Image Editing software to edit the images on this site.

##**Steps to setup the code in local environment** 

* I used VSCODE as my text-editing software to create this website.
* And I used XAMPP to convert my local system into a server system.

##**Future Plan**

* I plan to publish this website, so that real users can access it. 
* By publishing this I hope to gain more attraction from foreigners to visit this shop.
* And I wish to add more features to this site like Custom Package Creation , customize according to customer's preference etc.
